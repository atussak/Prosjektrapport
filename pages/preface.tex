\chapter{Preface}

This report covers the work of the specialization project for the masters study Cybernetics and Robotics at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). 
The work has been conducted with great counselling from supervisor Ã˜yvind Stavdahl. A lot of Stavdahl's previous work and notes also make out the mathematical foundation of the project. 

The developed snake robot simulator is based in MATLAB. The package \textit{Symbolic Math Toolbox} has been actively used. All code is written by me and can be accessed through the github repository blablalba.

The figures presented throughout the report are designed by me, unless stated otherwise.
