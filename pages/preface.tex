\chapter{Preface}

This report covers the work of the specialization project for the masters study Cybernetics and Robotics at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). 
The work has been conducted with great counselling from supervisor Øyvind Stavdahl. A lot of Stavdahl's previous work and notes also make out the mathematical foundation of the project. 
Furthermore, Irja Gravdahl has contributed to valuable discussions on the topic.

All simulator code is written from scratch by me. The figures presented throughout the report are also designed by me, unless stated otherwise. When it comes to data presentation, Åsmund Eek has provided great advice on generation of plots in MATLAB.
