%A number of different principles for snake robot locomotion have been proposed and tested, many of which are based on heuristic rules and stiff position controlled joints. A more physics-based and compliant method is being developed which is based on the formalism of hybrid position/force control. In this assignment you will study this emerging technique and simulate an idealized two-dimensional snake robot propelled by contact forces based on hybrid position/force control in an idealized environment comprising frictionless movement and extentionless environmental assets (“obstacles”).\\


Snake robots are robust serial link robots able to propel uneven and irregular terrain. As opposed to traditional mobile robots, the snake robot can utilize the obstacles found in the environment to push itself forward along a predefined path. The aforementioned mode of locomotion is referred to as obstacle aided locomotion (OAL). 

Hybrid position/force control (HPFC) is studied with emphasis on application within OAL and general simultaneous contact force- and shape control of snake robots. The main principle of HPFC together with a simplified model of the snake robot and its environment are the backbone of the developed MATLAB simulator. The objective of this simulator is visualization of the snake robots behavior and OAL in simple path following cases.
Lastly, some relevant scenarios displaying the results and limitations of the simulator and the HPFC-based method are presented. \hl{Skriv spesifikke resultater}
